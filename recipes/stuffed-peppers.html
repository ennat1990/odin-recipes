            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Tuscan Heat Spice</li>
            <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
            <li>Chicken Stock Concentrate</li>
            <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2> 
       <ol>
            <li>• Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Halve bell peppers lengthwise; remove stems and seeds. Place on a baking sheet and drizzle each half with oil; rub to coat. Season with salt and pepper; arrange cut sides down. • Roast on middle rack until browned and softened, 18-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>• While bell peppers roast, melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add couscous and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until toasted, 2-3 minutes. • Stir in ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4). Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until couscous is tender, 6-8 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to use in step 4. • Meanwhile, halve, peel, and dice half the onion (whole onion for 4). Finely dice tomato.</li>
            <li>• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. • Add beef* and Tuscan Heat Spice; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.</li>
            <li>• Add marinara sauce and tomato to pan with beef mixture; stir until thoroughly combined. • Stir in stock concentrate and 1⁄3 cup water (²⁄3 cup for 4 servings); season with salt and pepper. Simmer until slightly thickened, 1-2 minutes. • Stir in couscous until thoroughly combined. Turn off heat.</li>
            <li>• Once bell peppers are done, flip and stuff each half with as much filling as will fit. Place in pan with remaining filling, nestling each stuffed pepper into mixture. (TIP: If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer extra filling and stuffed peppers to a small baking dish now.) Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella.</li>
            <li>• Roast stuffed peppers on middle rack until cheese melts, 3-4 minutes. • Divide remaining filling between plates. Top with stuffed peppers and serve.</li>
